# calc
argument based calcuator without order of operations(yet hopefully).

ABOUT: 
I got bored and decided to make this its a simple program that i figured I would use a bit just to do simple calculatons when need be.
The only dependencies is the C libary. I plan on flushing this out in the future and making this a much better product. For the time 
being it's still a basic program I feel could get some decent use.

COMPILE:
execute ./comp.sh and will compile the program. The output will be a exectutable named "calc" 

USAGE:
to use the calculator feed arguments with numbers and the operations you want done to the first number. 

EXAMPLE: 
"1 + 2 x 3"
OPERATORS:
"+" to add
"x" to multiply
"-" to subtract
"/" to divide
